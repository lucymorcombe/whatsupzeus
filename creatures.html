            <p class="creatures">A centaur is a half human, half horse creature. They have the torso and head of a human and the lower body and legs of a horse. In a lot of stories, centaurs are shown to be aggressive drunks, picking fights with each other and any potential threats. Some centaurs, though, were known for their wisdom. The most famous centaur in Greek mythology is Chiron, who was a respected teacher of many Greek heroes. </p>

            <p class="creatures"> The sphinx had the face of a woman, the body of a lion and the wings of an eagle. The sphinx was known for terrorising the city of Thebes, asking all who passed her to answer a riddle and killing those who could not answer. The riddle was this:<br><br> Which is the creature that has one voice, but has four feet in the morning, two feet in the afternoon, and three feet at night?<br><br> The answer was "man", and after Oedipus gave the sphinx the correct answer, she threw herself from a cliff in anger and no longer threatened the people of Thebes.</p>
