            <p>Zeus was secretly raised in Crete by a goat named Amalthea! His father, Kronos, believed that he had eaten his 6th son, just as he had eaten the 5 that came before him. Prophecies told Kronos that he would be overthrown by one of his children, so he believed that the only way to avoid this fate was to swallow his new-borns whole.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="zeusInfo2 gInfo">
            <p>By the time Zeus was born, Zeus’ mum Rhea couldn’t watch her husband eat another one of her children. She tricked Kronos by giving him a baby-shaped rock to swallow instead and then snuck off to Crete to give birth to Zeus. And she raised him to take revenge on his dad.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="zeusInfo3 gInfo">
            <p>When he turned 17 Zeus’ mum brought him back home. The shock of finding out his son was still alive led Kronos to feel very unwell, so unwell in fact that he vomited. And out of his mouth came the baby-shaped rock that Rhea had fed him 17 years ago – and that was not all!</p>
        </div>



        <div class="zeusInfo4 gInfo">
            <p>One by one Kronos vomited up the 5 children he had swallowed. First Hera, then Poseidon, Demeter, Hades and finally Hestia – all fully grown. A 10 year war then started and eventually the other side surrendered, leaving Zeus as King of the Gods.</p>
        </div>



        <div class="zeusInfo5 gInfo">
            <p>Zeus decided he wanted to form his own group of leaders, giving each of his siblings a role and sitting them beside him on Olympus. He decided 12 would be the perfect number of Olympians. He and his siblings made 5 as Hades did not count and the remaining spots were filled by some of Zeus’ children.</p>

                    <p>&#9734; He was deformed as a baby and Hera did not want a child like that and disposed of him. He got his revenge by sending Hera a chair that, once she sat on it, would not let her go. Zeus set a prize for whoever could free Hera from this chair – and this prize was the marriage of Aphrodite, the Goddess of love and beauty. </p>

                <li>
                    <p>&#9734; He was a kind and peaceful God and was never fully accepted because of his deformities.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>&#9734; When Hera, Zeus’ wife, found out that Leto was pregnant with more of Zeus’ children, she caused all land to shun Leto and she had to search far and wide for a place to give birth. Eventually she found a floating island that was not attached to the ocean floor and gave birth there.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>&#9734; He was known for his Lyre, a small musical instrument, and the songs he would play wherever he went. This lyre was made by Hermes and given to Apollo as an apology for stealing one of his cows.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>&#9734; He is often associated with the sun, which was pulled around the world everyday by the sun chariot, led by flying horses. In some mythology Apollo is identified as the driver of this chariot. </p>

                <li>
                    <p>&#9734; He taught medicine to humans and was often called ‘The Healer’. </p>

                <li>
                    <p>&#9734; When he was angry, he would send mice to earth to invade towns and cities, and get rid of them again when he was in a better mood. Because of this, he became known as a ‘Mouse Demon.’</p>

                <li>
                    <p>&#9734; When she left for the Underworld, her mother Demeter was heartbroken and searched far and wide to get her back. Eventually she went to Zeus who ordered that she must return to her mother, but Hades made it so that she would spend 6 months with him and 6 months with Demeter.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>&#9734; Hades made Persephone eat a pomegranate, which is the fruit of the Underworld, before leaving him. This trick meant that she was tied to him and the Underworld forever. </p>

                    <p>&#9734; Her parents were Zeus and Metis.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>&#9734; When Metis was pregnant, Zeus heard a prophecy that she would give birth to a son who would overthrow him. This caused Zeus great concern and he started chasing Metis, trying to kill her and their unborn child. In this chase, Metis kept transforming into different creatures to try and get away. She eventually turned into a fly and Zeus ate her. This did not kill Metis, though, and she travelled through his body and made a home in his head, and it was here that she gave birth to Athena.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>&#9734; Athena began banging on the inside of Zeus’ head, trying to get out. This gave Zeus headaches that were so bad that he asked Hephaestus to cut his head open to find what was causing it. </p>

                <li>
                    <p>&#9734; Hephaestus did what was asked of him and after opening Zeus’ skull, Athena emerged fully grown and equipped with armour. Metis’ fate was never discussed again so we have to assume that she continued living inside Zeus’ head. </p>

                <li>
                    <p>&#9734; She was Zeus’ favourite child and he trusted her with his powerful thunderbolts.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>&#9734; His parents were Zeus and Semele, who was a human. This made Dionysus a demi-God and he was the only Olympian who had a mortal mother. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>&#9734; Once Semele was pregnant, Hera disguised herself as an old lady and told Semele that she should demand to see Zeus’ true form. When interacting with mortals, Gods had to disguise their true being because humans would die if they saw it. Zeus, who was smitten with Semele, granted her one wish and she wished to see Zeus, as he really was. Because he had granted her a wish, Zeus could not deny her of this, and Semele died.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>&#9734; Zeus managed to rescue his unborn son by taking him from Semele’s womb and sewing him into his thigh. A few months later, Dionysus was born from the wound Zeus cut into his thigh and he was taken to be raised by rain nymphs, where he was safe from Hera.</p>

                    <p>&#9734; His parents were Zeus and Maia and, surprisingly for a child of one of Zeus' affairs, there are no stories of Hera trying to sabotage him.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>&#9734; He was an extraordinary baby. At less than 1 day old, he pulled himself out of his crib and announced to his mother that he was going on a walk. On this walk, he found a field full of cows, which he led back to the cave that he had left his mother in. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>&#9734; What he didn’t know, however, was that these cows belonged to Apollo and were very important to him. Apollo followed the cows' prints to Hermes and was ready to punish the thief.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>&#9734; In the time it took Apollo to reach him, Hermes had invented the lyre, which is a small stringed instrument. He offered this to Apollo as an apology and returned all but 2 of the cows to him, one of which had been eaten by him and his mother and the other sacrificed to the Gods of Olympus. Apollo was very impressed by Hermes and the lyre and took the child to Olympus to meet his family, who were all very fond of him.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>&#9734; He acted as a messenger for the Gods and was considered a ‘trickster’ because he was so clever and cunning.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>&#9734; He was known for his winged sandals and winged helmet which allowed him to fly, making him perfect for the role of messenger.</p>
