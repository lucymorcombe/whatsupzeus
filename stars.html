            <p class="stars"> Andromeda was a young woman whose mother, called Cassiopeia, boasted that she was the most beautiful woman in the world – even more beautiful than the Gods. This angered the Gods of Olympus, especially Poseidon who had created his sea nymphs to be the most beautiful beings alive. In his anger, Poseidon created a terrible sea monster named Cetus and demanded that Cassiopeia must sacrifice her daughter to the creature! Andromeda was chained to a large rock awaiting her horrible fate when Perseus, a great Greek hero, found her. Perseus was on his way back from slaying the gorgon Medusa who had snakes for hair that would turn you to stone with one look. He fought off the sea monster by pulling Medusa’s recently beheaded head from his bag and the monster turned to stone. Andromeda was saved and she lived as Perseus’ wife and Queen.</p>

Ganymede was the most handsome young man that the Gods had ever seen and they were shocked by his good looks. Ganymede caught the attention of Zeus, who sent his messenger eagle, Aquila, down to bring the young man to him. Zeus gave Ganymede the job of being his cupbearer, serving water and wine to him and all the other Gods. The word Aquarius means water carrier in Latin. Zeus placed Ganymede amongst the stars because he was mortal and sadly could not live forever. </p>

                The most famous story of Aquila is that the eagle came down to earth and brought Ganymede to Olympus to serve Zeus as his cup-bearer.

            <p class="stars"> There was once a King named Athamas who had two children, a boy named Phrixus and his twin sister Helle. The children’s step mum and Athamas’ new wife, Ino, was very mean to the twins and treated them very badly. One of the Greek Gods, Hermes, noticed how badly the children were being treated and sent them a magical flying ram so they could escape their cruel stepmother. Whilst the twins were flying, Helle fell off the ram and drowned in the sea far below - this part of the sea was named the Hellespont after her.<br><br>
                Phrixus landed safely in a Kingdom named Colchis and to show his gratitude to Hermes and the Gods, he sacrificed the ram. He gave the priceless Golden Fleece to the King of Colchis, which would later play a huge part in the story ‘Jason and the Argonauts’. To honour the ram and the role it played in saving the children from their horrible stepmother, Zeus placed it in the sky as the constellation Aries.

            <p class="stars"> Hercules was a great Greek hero and one of the most well-known figures of Greek mythology. As Zeus’ son he was half human, half God. Hera, Zeus’ wife, hated Hercules as he was a reminder of Zeus’ affairs with other women. Because Hera hated Hercules so much, she made him lose his mind and in his insanity he murdered his own wife and children. When Hercules awoke from his temporary insanity, he had to face the consequences of what he had done. He was set 12 labours to be done over 12 years to rid the world of evil, but these tasks were almost impossible. <br><br>
                Hercules’ second labour was to kill the Hydra, an enormous nine-headed snake. Hercules quickly learnt that after cutting off one of these heads, two more grew in its place. Luckily, Hercules brought his nephew, Iolas, to help. Hercules would cut off a head and Iolas would use fire to burn the wound and stop more heads sprouting. Hera desperately wanted Hercules to fail and she could see that he was succeeding. To stop this, she sent a large crab to distract Hercules by grabbing his foot and making him fail in his task. However, this plan quickly backfired when Hercules stomped on and killed the crab, and then went on to defeat the Hydra. <br><br>
                Zeus placed the crab into the night sky as the constellation Cancer to honour Hercules’ victory and to remind Hera of her failure.

                Capricornus, also known as Capricorn, depicts the front half of a goat and the tail of a fish and it is thought to be in honor of Amalthea, the goat who raised Zeus. Zeus was the sixth of his father, Kronos’, children and the five that came before him were swallowed whole by Kronos! This was to avoid the prophecy he had been given that he would be overthrown by his own child. Zeus’ mother, Rhea, however, could not stand to see another of her children eaten and tricked Kronos into eating a rock instead of her 6th child. She then ran off to hide Zeus and she left him with the goat Amalthea and a group of nymphs called the Meliae. Amalthea was a guardian, a friend and a teacher to Zeus and to pay his respects to her kindness he created the constellation Capricornus.

                Queen Casseopia, wife of King Cephus and mother of Andromeda, was very beautiful. She boasted that she was the most beautiful woman in the world, even more so than the Gods! Poseidon, the God of the sea, was greatly offended by this statement because he believed he had created the most beautiful beings to ever exist – his sea nymphs. In his anger, he created a great sea monster, Cetus, to wreak havoc for sailors and villages on the coast and Poseidon ordered that for this to stop Cassiopeia needed to say that his sea nymphs are more beautiful than her, but she refused. Cetus continued its destruction and Poseidon said that he would call the monster back, but first Cassiopeia must sacrifice her daughter, Andromeda, to the sea monster.<br><br>
                Andromeda was taken to a rock in the sea to be sacrificed, but she was saved by the great hero Perseus, and Cetus was turned to stone! Poseidon and Zeus decided that Cassiopeia should be placed in the sky as a constellation, but upside-down. This humiliation was punishment for being so conceited.

The Gods also thought he was weak because he allowed his daughter to be sacrificed to the sea monster. As punishment, Cepheus was placed next to Cassiopeia in the night sky where he has to listen to her boasting for eternity.

                For the story of the Corona Borealis constellation, also known as Ariadne’s Crown, you first must know the story of the Minotaur. <br><br>
                King Minos, the king of Crete, had a son who had the body of a man but the head of a bull. Minos had a huge labyrinth built to keep in the flesh-eating Minotaur. This labyrinth was so complex that even the designer, Daedalus would struggle to find his way around. Each year, the Minotaur would need to eat and 12 young people would be selected and sent into the labyrinth and one year a man named Theseus was chosen. Minos’ daughter Ariadne fell in love with Theseus and together they planned his escape from the labyrinth and his slaying of the Minotaur, so no more young people would die by his hands. Using a ball of magical thread, Theseus killed the monster and returned to Ariadne to flee Crete.<br><br>
                Theseus and Ariadne sailed to an island named Naxos to start their life together, but one night the God Dionysus, the God of wine, came to Theseus and told him how he had chosen Ariadne to be his wife and Theseus would have to leave – and you don’t ignore requests from Gods! The next morning Ariadne woke up all alone on a strange island with no idea why she had been deserted by Theseus, but soon Dionysus came to confess his love and take Ariadne to Olympus so they could get married.<br><br>
                Dionysus had a crown made for Ariadne with seven jewels on it and when Ariadne died, Zeus placed her crown in the night sky and changed the jewels to stars, creating the constellation Corona Borealis.<br>

                The constellation Cygnus, also known as The Northern Cross, tells the story of 2 great friends named Cygnus and Phaeton. Cygnus and Phaeton loved to have competitions with one another and one day they decided to race across the sky, around the Sun and back to Earth. They both made an awful mistake, however, and flew too closely to the sun, burning their chariots and sending them falling down to Earth. Cygnus survived the fall but soon discovered that Phaeton had not and was trapped by the roots of a tree at the bottom of a river. Cygnus tried and tried to rescue Phaeton so that he could give him a proper burial, but the river was too deep. In his hour of need, Cygnus prayed to Zeus for help. Zeus heard his prayers and offered to turn Cygnus into a swan, so that he could swim deep enough to retrieve his friend’s body. However, Zeus explained that if Cygnus chose to do this he would be giving up his immortality and would only live as long as an average swan. Cygnus agreed to this immediately and gave his friend a proper burial. In honour of their friendship and this selfless act, Zeus placed the image of Cygnus the swan into the night sky.

                This story is about a man named Arion. Arion was a very talented musician and poet and was good friends with the King of Corinth, Periander. Periander was a huge fan of Arion’s art and persuaded him to enter a competition in Sicily and convinced him to split his winnings with him. Arion won the competition by a landslide and decided to make his way back to Corinth to celebrate with his friend. However, on the boat that was taking him home were sailors who wanted to kill Arion and steal his riches! To buy himself more time, Arion asked the sailors if he could play one final song before he was killed. This song attracted a number of dolphins who gathered around the boat and Arion launched himself from the boat to try and save himself and quickly one of the dolphins came to his aid and carried him safely to the shore. This constellation was placed in the night sky in honour of this, and the many other times dolphins have helped save lives.

                The story of the constellation Draco, also known as The Dragon, is also the story of a man named Cadmus and the city of Thebes. <br><br>
                Cadmus was the son of the King of Phoenicia and the sister to Europa, a young woman who Zeus had taken an interest in and one day stole her from her home. Cadmus was sent to search for Europa and was ordered not to return until he had found her. For years Cadmus wandered the world looking for his sister but eventually gave up – aware that nothing could be found if Zeus didn’t want it to be. Knowing he could not return home without his sister, Cadmus began searching for somewhere to start a new city and, with the help of Apollo, soon found somewhere. However, while searching for water, Cadmus’ friends were killed by a large dragon. Cadmus set off to find and kill this dragon and he succeeded, receiving advice to plant the dead dragon’s teeth in the ground! From the dragon's teeth grew warriors who fought each other to the death until there were only 5 left. These 5 were destined to help Cadmus build his city of Thebes. <br><br>
                This, as well as many other stories of dragons in Greek Mythology, led to the placement of the constellation Draco.

They sailed with Jason and the Argonauts in search of the Golden fleece and saved their fellow Argonauts during a storm which nearly sank their ship and killed them all. Without the twins, the story of Jason and the Argonauts would not have a happy ending. To thank them for their help in this quest ,their incredible strength and their love for one another, the constellation Gemini was placed in the night sky.

                Hercules is one of the greatest heroes of Greek Mythology. He was a son of Zeus, who loved him very much, and a human named Alcmene, making him a demigod. Hercules was raised on Earth by his mother and lived as a mortal for the first half of his life, before being brought up to Mount Olympus to join the Olympians there. He was known for his great strength, courage and agility, as well as for his famous 12 labours. These came out because of Hera’s jealousy of how much Zeus loved him, and the fact that she was not his mother. Because Hera hated Hercules so much, she made him lose his mind and, in his insanity, he murdered his own wife and children. When Hercules awoke from his temporary insanity, he had to face the consequences of what he had done. He was set 12 labours to be done over 12 years to rid the world of evil, but these tasks were almost impossible. Hercules completed the 12 labours nobly and extremely well and the world was a better place for it. Zeus placed his favourite son in the night sky to honour his courage and his impact on Earth.

                Hercules was a great Greek hero and one of the most well-known figures of Greek mythology. As Zeus’ son he was half human, half God. Hera, Zeus’ wife, hated Hercules as he was a reminder of Zeus’ affairs with other women. Because Hera hated Hercules so much, she made him lose his mind and in his insanity he murdered his own wife and children. When Hercules awoke from his temporary insanity, he had to face the consequences of what he had done. He was set 12 labours to be done over 12 years to rid the world of evil, but these tasks were almost impossible. <br><br>
                For his first labour, Hercules was set the task of killing the ferocious Nemean Lion who feasted on animals and humans. Many men had lost their lives trying to slay this lion and allow the people of Nemea to live safely again – but the lion could not be injured by any weapon as its skin was so tough. Knowing this, Hercules entered the lion’s cave and used all of his strength to strangle and kill the lion, saving the people of Nemea. This great act of heroism was celebrated by Zeus by placing the defeated lion in the sky in the form of Leo.

                The constellation Lyra represents the lyre, which is a small stringed musical instrument, created by Hermes who gifted it to Apollo, the God of Music. Apollo then gifted this lyre to Orpheus, who became well known for the love songs he would play for his wife Eurydice. It is said that when he played all people and animals would stop whatever they were doing and the trees would stand still. Unfortunately, his beloved wife died suddenly one day, and Orpheus was so heartbroken that he travelled to the entrance of the underworld to try and win her back from Hades. Orpheus entered the underworld playing his lyre and was thrilled to find out that Hades was enjoying his music. When he finished playing, Hades applauded the musician and Orpheus asked that in return for his music, could Hades release his wife. Hades agreed, as long as Orpheus trusted Hades to keep his word and left the underworld playing his lyre and never looking back to make sure Euridice was following, if Orpheus doubted or did not trust Hades and looked back, Eurydice would be taken back by Hades into the underworld. For most of the journey, Orpheus followed Hades’ instructions and could hear his wife’s footsteps behind him. However, at the very end of the trek out of the underworld, the footsteps faded, and Orpheus could not bear the silence and turned to check his wife was okay. As he turned, he saw Euridice fading away, back into the underworld. <br><br>
                When Orpheus died, Zeus placed the constellation Lyra into the sky in honour of his beautiful music and the great love Orpheus had for Eurydice.

                Orion was a skilled hunter, who provided meat every day for the Gods. One day, Artemis (Goddess of the hunt) asked Orion if she could join him on his daily hunt. Whilst the pair were hunting together, Orion made an excellent shot and killed a deer, which greatly impressed Artemis. Artemis told all the Gods of Orion’s talent as an archer. All of this praise from Artemis and the Gods thrilled Orion and he wanted to impress her even more. The next morning, Orion woke up early and shot every animal he found and made a pile of them outside Artemis’ house. Expecting her to be pleased, Orion was shocked when Artemis was horrified. This was because whilst being the Goddess of the hunt, Artemis was also the protector of animals and punished anyone who would kill more than they could eat. In her anger, she stomped her foot on the ground and out of the dust came a great scorpion which stung Orion on the heel causing him to die in great pain. But in honor of his great service to the gods, Zeus placed his constellation in the sky.<br><br> This constellation is famously known as Orion's belt.

Pegasus was a friend to a Greek hero named Bellerophon and helped him in his mission to destroy the Chimera – a fire breathing monster with the body of a lion, a snake for a tail and a goat head coming out of its back. After defeating the Chimera, Bellerophon attempted to fly, riding Pegasus, up to Mount Olympus to live with the Gods, thinking he was worthy of that. Zeus was offended by Bellerophon’s arrogance and sent an insect to sting Pegasus and send Bellerophon falling back to Earth. Pegasus was then kept on Mount Olympus to serve the Gods and this constellation was placed among the stars to honour his service.

                Perseus was the son of Zeus and a human woman named Danae. His grandfather, Acrisius, locked him and his mother in a wooden box and threw them into the sea because he didn’t want to lose his throne. However, the box did not sink, so Perseus and his mother floated to another kingdom named Seriphos and the king, Polydectes, quickly fell in love with Danae and wanted her to marry him. Danae rejected his offer because she wanted to give all of her time to raising Perseus. <br><br>
                When Perseus had grown into a young man, Polydectes tricked him into a dangerous mission – to kill the gorgon Medusa who had snakes instead of hair that would turn anyone who looks into them into stone. Polydectes was certain that this mission would kill Perseus and then he would be free to marry Danae. As a son of Zeus, some of the other Gods wanted to help Perseus. Athena gave him her golden shield so he could use it as a mirror and wouldn’t have to look directly at Medusa, Hermes gave him a pair of sandals with wings on them so he could fly to find Medusa and a golden sword sharp enough to cut her head off, and Hades gave him a helmet that would turn Perseus invisible. With the help of all of these things, Perseus managed to behead Medusa and make it back home just in time to stop the wedding of Polydectes and Danae, turning the King and his subjects to stone with Medusa’s head.<br><br>
                Also, on the way home from slaying Medusa, Perseus saved Andromeda from the sea monster Cetus and she returned to Seriphos with him to be his wife. After his death, Zeus gave Perseus a place among the constellations next to his beloved Andromeda.

                As we know, Zeus was not loyal to his wife Hera and one of his most-loved girlfriends was a beautiful nymph named Callisto. Zeus would take frequent visits to earth to see his beloved Callisto, which angered Hera and sparked her need for revenge. <br> <br>

She ordered Zeus to return to Mount Olympus with her. Zeus wanted to stay in the forest to turn Callisto back to her true form, but Hera insisted. <br><br>
                Alone in the forest and in the form of a large bear, Callisto stumbled across her son Arcas who was out hunting.

                This constellation tells the story of Phaethon, who was the son of the Sun God, Helios. Phaethon lived on Earth with his mortal mother, Clymene, and was often told stories of his father. Helios was responsible for driving the sun chariot, a horse-drawn carriage that flew the sun around the world, creating the day time. Helios was not very present in his son’s life, which upset Phaethon. To prove his fatherhood and his love for his son, Helios granted Phaethon one wish. Expecting his son to wish for money or love, Helios was shocked when Phaethon’s wish was to fly the sun chariot. This is a very difficult and dangerous job and Helios pleaded with his son to change his wish, but Phaethon was adamant. <br><br>
                Phaethon set off in the chariot but was completely unable to control the horses who guided it. He lost control and the chariot began to fly too close to the earth, burning the ground and creating deserts. The chariot was then thrust upwards, meaning the earth wasn’t getting nearly enough heat. This began to freeze the land and created areas like Antarctica and the North Pole. To avoid any further damage and in anger of Phaethon’s stupidity, Zeus threw a thunderbolt at the boy, causing him to die and fall from the chariot, landing in the river Eridanus.

This especially angered Poseidon who believed that he had created the most beautiful beings when he created his sea nymphs. The Gods ordered Cassiopeia to apologise, but she refused. Because of her refusal, the Gods declared that the only way Cetus would leave her country alone was if she sacrificed her daughter, Andromeda, to it. Cassiopeia agreed, and her daughter was tied to a rock by the sea, awaiting her brutal end. This, however, is when Perseus was returning from killing Medusa, and he slayed the monster and rescued Andromeda. The pair returned to Perseus’ home and married. They lived out the rest of their days happily as husband and wife and king and queen.

                The constellation Virgo represents virginity and purity, and is said to portray Persephone, the daughter of Zeus and Demeter. <br><br>
                One day, Persephone was out enjoying nature when she was approached by Hades. Some stories say that Hades kidnapped Persephone whilst others say that she went willingly with him, but either way Persephone was taken to the Underworld to live as Hades’ wife and Queen of the Underworld. <br><br>
                Her mother Demeter, Goddess of the Harvest, was heartbroken to be separated from her daughter and no one knew where she was gone. In her grief, Demeter stopped tending to the harvest which meant that plants were dying and crops would not grow. Zeus soon intervened, finding Persephone in the Underworld and demanding Hades to release her. <br><br>
                Before leaving, Hades offered Persephone a pomegranate. In the Underworld, there is a thing called the ‘Law of Abode’, which means if any food or drink is consumed by an individual in Hades’ realm, they are destined to stay there forever and are not allowed to leave. Persephone, who did not know of this law, accepted the fruit and began eating. <br><br>
                Zeus had sent Hermes to collect Persephone from the Underworld safely, and he arrived to find Persephone eating her sixth pomegranate seed and Hades declaring her his bride. When Hermes shared this news with Zeus and Demeter, Demeter promised that no crops would ever grow again if her daughter was destined to a life in the Underworld. <br><br>
                As a compromise, Zeus ordered that Persephone was to spend six months of the year in the Underworld with Hades, due to the six pomegranate seeds she ate and she would spend the other six months with her mother on Mount Olympus. This compromise, however, led to Demeter neglecting the harvest for the six months of the year that Persephone was away – these six months are what we know as autumn and winter.
